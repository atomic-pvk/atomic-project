I have no clue why rfc5905 would specify that the refid would be a char since it is actually a uint32, either way I have changed it - A
Changed clear function in NTP_peer.c to use custom type MAXDISPAlg reason being that the algorithms will not run correctly with the original 16 (s) the other option would be upping MAXDIST from the rfc suggested
1 (s) to 40 (s) +. I compromised and changed the init to use MAXDISPAlg and changed the value of MAXDIST to allow more room for error. - A
memory has become an issue, pain - A

* This condition has changed in NTP_system_process.c for the function clock_update().
if (s.t >= p->t)
    {
        return;
    }
changed to:
if (s.t > p->t)
    {

        return;
    }
